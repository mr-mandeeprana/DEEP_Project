# Admin Account Setup Guide

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Install dependencies first
npm install

# Run the admin setup script
node scripts/setup-admin.js
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Create admin account manually
node scripts/create-admin.js
```

### Option 3: Secure Environment-Based Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Set environment variables first
export ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin@example.com
export ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
export ADMIN_DISPLAY_NAME="Platform Administrator"
export ADMIN_INITIAL_CREDITS=10000

# Run secure setup
node scripts/secure-admin-setup.js
```

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure you have the following in your `.env` file:
    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

    # Optional: Admin Account Configuration

    ```

2. **Supabase Tables**: Make sure these tables exist in your database:
   - `profiles`

- Keep service role keys secure and never expose in client code

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues during setup:

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all required env vars are set
2. **Database Connection**: Verify Supabase connection and table existence
3. **Permissions**: Confirm service role key has necessary permissions
4. **Logs**: Check browser console and server logs for error details

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to create admin account"**
- Check database permissions
- Verify environment variables
- Ensure Supabase service is running

**"Access denied. Admin privileges required"**
- Verify the email matches the designated admin email
- Check if user_roles table has the correct entry
- Confirm account is confirmed/verified

**"Environment variables missing"**

};
```

### Admin Role Checking
```javascript
import { useAdminRole } from '@/hooks/useAdminRole';

const { isSuperAdmin, hasRole, canManageUsers } = useAdminRole();
